## Data Cleansing Workflow

### Initial Data Assessment
2. **Data Source Verification**: Ensure that the data sources are reliable and the data collection methods are sound.
1. **Data Quality Overview**: Evaluate the overall quality of the data by identifying missing values, inconsistencies, and anomalies.

### Handling Missing Values
1. **Identify Missing Data**: Assess the extent and pattern of missing data in each column.
2. **Analyze Missing Data Mechanism**: Determine if the missing data is random or systematic.
3. **Strategies for Missing Data**: Decide on techniques like imputation, deletion, or flagging based on the data's nature and the missing data mechanism.

### Correcting Data Errors
1. **Anomaly Detection**: Identify outliers or unusual data points that may indicate errors.
2. **Validation Checks**: Implement checks for data consistency and logic (e.g., negative ages or dates in the future).
3. **Error Rectification**: Correct identified errors using methods like correction based on other data points, consultation with data source, or removal.

### Standardizing and Normalizing Data
1. **Data Standardization**: Ensure consistent formats and units across the dataset (e.g., date formats, measurement units).
2. **Data Normalization**: Scale numeric data to a standard range if necessary, especially for modeling purposes.

### Data Deduplication
1. **Identify Duplicates**: Use algorithms to detect duplicate records in the dataset.
2. **Resolve Duplicates**: Determine the best approach to handle duplicates, whether it's merging records or removing duplicates.

### Final Data Quality Check
1. **Data Quality Review**: Perform a final check to ensure all issues have been addressed.
2. **Documentation**: Record the steps taken during data cleansing for future reference and reproducibility.

### Preparation for Analysis
1. **Data Transformation**: Transform data into a format suitable for analysis or modeling.
2. **Data Backup**: Save a clean and backup copy of the dataset before proceeding to analysis.
